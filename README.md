# PRODIGY_SD_01
# Welcome to the Prodigy Internship Tasks repository! 
This repository contains all the assignments, projects, and code snippets that I have completed during my internship at Prodigy. The tasks span various areas of software engineering, showcasing my learning journey and contributions throughout the internship period.

# Repository Structure
Task-1: Build a temperature Conversion Program.

Task-2: Create a Guessing game.

Task-3: Implement a Simple Contact Management System.

Task-5: Web Scraping.


# Task-3: Implement a Simple Contact Management System.

## Technologies used: 
C++, Libraries.

## Key learnings: 

While writing the program, I was able to learn many new things, such as:

1. File I/O Operations: Gained a solid understanding of how to perform file input and output operations, including reading from and writing to files using ifstream and ofstream. Also learned the importance of proper error handling when dealing with file operations.
2. Structured Data Management: Learned how to manage structured data using custom data types and collections. This included defining a struct to encapsulate contact information, using a vector to store multiple contacts, and understanding data encapsulation and access through various methods to manipulate the data.
3. User Interface and Interaction: Improved knowledge of creating a user interface in the console and handling user input effectively. This involved displaying a menu, processing user choices using a switch statement, and formatting output for better readability using the iomanip library.
